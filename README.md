# BinarySearchTrees

Binary Search Tree data structure implementation


Implemented methods:

`buildTree` function that takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree  

`insert` inserts new node into BST

`deleteNode` deletes a node from BST

`find` returns true or false if node of given value was found

`minNode` returns min value that apperas in BST

`levelOrder` BFS implementation

`DFSInOrder` DFS inorder recursive implementation

`DFSPostOrder` DFS postorder recursive implementation

`DFSPreOrder` DFS preorder recursive implementation

`height` returns the height (the highest number of edges from node to leaf node) of provided node 

`depth` returns the depth (numbers of edges from node to tree's root node) of provided node 

`isBalanced` returns true if tree is balanced (difference between heights of the left subtree and the right subtree of every node is not more than 1), and false if it is not

 `rebalance` rebalances tree if it is unbalanced
